# Atltvhead
code for the Atltvhead Helmet
Twitch IRC chat commands to create animations and changes to the screen on the helmet. 
Helmet runs on ESP32 and runs from an arduino sketch. 

The cred.h file is for assigning wifi and twitch password information and will need to be created by you if you choose to use the sketch.
